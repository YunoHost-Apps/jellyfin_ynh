Welcome to this new Jellyfin 10.11.0 release! 🎉

As it’s a new major release, there are some things that have to be known before updating. Please read this **carefully**:

- To be able to upgrade to this new version, you should already be on version 10.10.7. If it’s not the case, please upgrade first to this version by cli `yunohost app upgrade $app -u https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/jellyfin_ynh/commit/be23267b55c6f2c2caeb23566357d0564fe2f914`
- The initial upgrade will include MULTIPLE LONG-RUNNING MIGRATIONS that may take up to several hours depending on your library size and state. DO NOT CANCEL OR INTERRUPT THE SYSTEM during these migrations; let them run overnight if possible on very large libraries. 
- After upgrading, it’s strongly recommended to run a full library scan to ensure that all data is correctly populated.
- Jellyfin 10.11.0 is NOT compatible with 32-bit ARM systems (armhf), like 1st and 2nd generation Raspberry Pis or other low-end or old SBCs, or any ARM system running a 32-bit operating system. You must be running an ARM64 operating system to run Jellyfin 10.11.0 on ARM systems.
