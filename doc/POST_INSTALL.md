__APP__ has its discovery ports (1900 and 7359) closed by default. These are used to offer automatic discovery of your Jellyfin instance to any compatible client connected on the same network (your local network).


To take advantage of this feature, you *can* open ports 1900 and 7359 **UDP** if your server is hosted at home, on your local network (in other words, not a VPS).
